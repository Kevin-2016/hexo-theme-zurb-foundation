<h1 id="Foundation_Icon_Font_Sets">Foundation Icon Font Sets</h1><p>Custom icon sets that are stored in a handy web font. A couple lines of CSS and the right markup will get you going in no time. These icons use the Private Use Area Unicode slots to ensure full accessibility.</p>
<p>We designed the glyphs to be refined enough to stand alone as a simple icon, but left room for the imagination. Since you’ll be dealing with a font, the opportunities are nearly limitless. Now your icons can be any size, any color and any style available in CSS.</p>
<h1 id="Usage">Usage</h1><ul>
<li>Download the icon font that you’re interested in.</li>
<li>Merge the <code>fonts</code> and <code>stylesheets</code>, or <code>sass</code> if you are using it, folders into your Foundation project.</li>
<li>The default code is <code>&lt;i class=&quot;fi-[set]-[icon]&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>, feel free to customize that to your needs.</li>
